            <p class="aboutbody">Johnny's owner came to us asking for the right car to drive his beloved canine companion around in. We found him the best balance in style and comfort that works for both him and Johnny. Today, Johnny's owner is the vice president of the American Civil Liberties Union, and Johnny faithfully and comfortably rides to work with him every day.</p>
