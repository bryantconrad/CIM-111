      <div class="desc desc1">
        You can find guitars in stores like Guitar Center or Sam Ash. If these options are price-prohibitive for you, you may be able to find one in your uncle's attic, or you could take one by force from a douche sitting under a tree serenading girls.

    <div class="item2">
      <li class="step step2">Get a pick or grow your fingernails</li>
      <div class="desc desc2">Depending on what kind of guitar you obtained in step 1 and what style you would like to play, you will either need a guitar pick or long fingernails. If you picked up an electric guitar, you will have an easier time playing something like rock, blues, or jazz, and should look for a pick. If you picked up a classical guitar, fingerstyle, classical, or flamenco are the way to go, so you'll need nails. Acoustic (steel-string) guitars can go either way, so why not grow out your nails <i>and</i> get a pick? Or tape picks to all of your fingers? Or surgically replace your fingertips with picks?</div>
    </div>

    <div class="item3">
      <li class="step step3">Tune your guitar</li>
      <div class="desc desc3">Buy a digital tuner, download a tuner app for your phone, or match your strings to the pitches on another instrument, like a piano. Tuning is an annoying but essential step; otherwise, you might as well be playing random notes. If your strings are new, they will go out of tune very frequently, so be prepared to une, tune, and then tune once more for good measure. After that, you're ready to tune!</div>
    </div>

    <div class="item4">
      <li class="step step4">Play your guitar</li>
      <div class="desc desc4">You're finally ready to play! You can play for yourself at home, go gig at a club, play on the street, go on tour and sell out Madison Square Garden... The world is your oyster. As long as you're playing, you're doing it right.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="item5">
      <li class="step step5">Smash your guitar</li>
      <div class="desc desc5">Now that you're a bona fide rockstar, you gotta live like one. Every banging rock show ends with a good guitar smash. Even if you're not playing rock, a quick smash will always make your performance memorable for you and your audience. Afterwards, go back to Step 1. Rinse and repeat.</div>
